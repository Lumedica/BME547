# Python Fundamentals

Approach to coding:  sequential, object, state machine, modular

Use a text editor for now, talk about development environments later

Start with simple code -> Modules (collection of functional items)
->Package (bundles of modules) -> Classes (object oriented)

Make a new repository from gitbash (mkdir, cd to new dir, git init)

Vim fun.py

Define 'main' - description without algorithmic function
