# Basic Flask Web Service

Often useful to store information in the cloud.
Develop a web server to allow us to GET and POST data from an online resource.

Begin by recalling what we learned last time.
https://github.com/awaxye/BME547/blob/master/Lectures/Lecture12Mar8.md
Discussed html, API's and resources within python for interacting with web servers

First we looked at simple http handler but then moved on to requests

```
pip install requests
```

See previous lecture for example use, calling API at google maps.

Also, see Dr. Ward's info page 

https://github.com/dward2/BME547/blob/server_in_class_items/Resources/WebServices/requests.md

Let's run through his example interaction with github...


# Make a server of your own
First, see info page on virtual machines

https://github.com/dward2/BME547/blob/master/Resources/virtual_machines.md

We will use VM for our webservers.  Probably best to request no power off option.
