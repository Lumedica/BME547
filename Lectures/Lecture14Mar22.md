# Basic Flask Web Service

Often useful to store information in the cloud.
Develop a web server to allow us to GET and POST data from an online resource.

Begin by recalling what we learned last time.
https://github.com/awaxye/BME547/blob/master/Lectures/Lecture12Mar8.md
Discussed html, API's and resources within python for interacting with web servers

First we looked at simple http handler but then moved on to requests

```
pip install requests
```

See previous lecture for example use, calling API at google maps.
